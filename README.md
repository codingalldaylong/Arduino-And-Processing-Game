# Arduino-And-Processing-Game

Hi! In this repository you will find the diagram made in Fritzing with all the components you will need and how to place them.
You also have the code in 2 folders (Processing + multimedia material and Arduino), which is commented in Spanish, so you can replicate the project.

Thanks for your interest!
